    Hello, I'm Michelangelo (Mike) Ascalon, and my life has been a tapestry of diverse experiences. Born and raised in the Philippines, I embarked on a late-entry military career at the age of 32, which led me to a role as a dental hygienist. During my time in the Army, I had a remarkable year-long assignment driving a General. This experience offered a unique perspective on military life. Outside of my military service, I have a profound love for photography and outdoor adventures. Join me on this multifaceted journey as we explore the world through my lens, share thrilling outdoor activities, and delve into intriguing stories from my time behind the wheel, all with a touch of Filipino heritage.
